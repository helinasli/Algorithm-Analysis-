# Sorting and Tree Algorithms Implementation

This repository contains three projects focusing on sorting and tree algorithms for analyzing and comparing their performance on different population datasets.

## Project 1: Quicksort Algorithms

- Implementations of various Quicksort algorithms with different pivot selection strategies.
- Comparative analysis of runtime efficiency and number of comparisons.

## Project 2: Heapsort Algorithm and Priority Queue Operations

- Implementation of Heapsort algorithm and priority queue operations using max heap.
- Comparative analysis with other sorting algorithms.

## Project 3: Red-Black Tree vs Binary Search Tree (BST)

- Implementation of Red-Black Tree and Binary Search Tree (BST).
- Comparative analysis of tree height based on different population datasets.
- Time complexity analysis for various operations in both trees.

These projects provide insights into the strengths and weaknesses of different algorithms in different scenarios. Check individual project folders for detailed implementations and analysis.

Feel free to explore each project for in-depth details and code.
